# CollMule
CollMule is my Master Thesis project which title is ""CollMule: An opportunistic data collection system for IoT-based Indoor Air Quality Monitoring"

Supervised by Prof. Arkady Zaslavsky, Dr Saguna, Dr Karan Mitra and Dr. Prem Prakash Jayaraman

Abstract: Opportunistic sensing advance methods of IoT data collection using the mobility of data mules, the proximity of transmitting sensor devices and cost efficiency to decide when, where, how and at what cost collect IoT data and deliver it to a sink. This paper proposes, develops, implements and evaluates the algorithm called CollMule which builds on and extends the 3D kNN approach to discover, negotiate, collect and deliver the sensed data in an energy- and cost-efficient manner. The developed CollMule software prototype uses Android platform to handle indoor air quality data from heterogeneous IoT devices. The CollMule evaluation is based on performing rate, power consumption and CPU usage of single algorithm cycle. The outcomes of these experiments prove the feasibility of CollMule use on mobile smart devices.
